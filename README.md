# Basic Go Socket Programming interacting With DialogFlow API

To run server :

    go run .\src\server\server.go                                                             

To run client :

     go run .\src\client\client.go                        

P.S : enclose messages from client - cli in inverted commas(e.g "Hello") or else the server would crash.
